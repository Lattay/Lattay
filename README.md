### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a junior researcher in computational chemistry/material science, and a hobbyist programmer.
I am passionate about programming languages, open source and many other topics regarding computer science.

I have a [homepage here](https://lattay.srht.site).

Most of my projects are now living at [Sourcehut](https://git.sr.ht/~lattay)
and I am removing projects from Github because I do not think github has the
interests of their user at heart. I would rather pay a service and be respected
as a user, which is why I chose sourcehut. I still use github when it comes to
contributing to open-source projects of course. I am also present on
[gitlab](https://gitlab.com/lattay), also for contributing to open-source
projects.

Anyway, here are some of my favorite projects:

Some Neovim plugins:
- [make.nvim](https://git.sr.ht/~lattay/make.nvim) `:make` any project, for all the languages
- [slimy.nvim](https://git.sr.ht/~lattay/slimy.nvim) integrate the REPLs in Neovim
- [wiki.nvim](https://git.sr.ht/~lattay/wiki.nvim) a personal wiki in markdown
- [browz.nvim](https://git.sr.ht/~lattay/browz.nvim) a UI plugin similar to Telescope (but much simpler)

Some fun C stuff:
- [terminal.h](https://git.sr.ht/~lattay/terminal.h) a single file library to interact with the terminal
- [chaitea](https://git.sr.ht/~lattay/chaitea) a C port of [bubbletea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea)

Some Python stuff:
- [pysh](https://git.sr.ht/~lattay/pysh) write shell like (file manipulation)
  scripts but with a real language
- [vbelt](https://git.sr.ht/~lattay/vbelt) a toolbelt to work with VASP

And also:
- [goto](https://git.sr.ht/~lattay/goto) a multiplatform tool to jump to
  favorite directories
- [ltls](https://git.sr.ht/~lattay/ltls) a [language server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Server_Protocol)
  connecting to [LanguageTool](https://languagetool.org) for spell-checking latex source
  written in Go
